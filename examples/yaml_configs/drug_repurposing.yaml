# Drug Repurposing Analysis
#
# Identify potential drug repurposing opportunities for breast cancer
# using network analysis and perturbation simulation.

hypothesis: "Identify repurposing candidates for breast cancer treatment"

description: |
  Drug repurposing workflow including:
  - Disease pathway identification (KEGG + Reactome)
  - Known drug-target mappings (KEGG)
  - Target network construction (STRING)
  - Off-target prediction (network overlap)
  - Expression validation (HPA)
  - Cancer specificity assessment
  - MRA simulation of drug effects
  - Pathway enrichment analysis
