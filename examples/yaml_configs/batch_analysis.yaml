# Batch Analysis - Multiple Diseases and Targets
#
# Compare multiple cancer types to identify common and unique
# therapeutic targets and pathways.

hypothesis: "Comparative analysis of breast, lung, and prostate cancers"

description: |
  Batch analysis of three major cancer types to identify:
  - Common oncogenic pathways
  - Cancer-specific markers
  - Shared therapeutic targets
  - Tissue-specific expression patterns

scenarios:
  # Breast Cancer Analysis
  - id: 1
    name: "Breast Cancer Network"
    disease_query: "breast cancer"
    tissue_context: breast
  
  - id: 3
    name: "Breast Cancer Markers"
    cancer_type: "breast cancer"
    tissue_context: breast
  
  # Lung Cancer Analysis
  - id: 1
    name: "Lung Cancer Network"
    disease_query: "lung cancer"
    tissue_context: lung
  
  - id: 3
    name: "Lung Cancer Markers"
    cancer_type: "lung cancer"
    tissue_context: lung
  
  # Prostate Cancer Analysis
  - id: 1
    name: "Prostate Cancer Network"
    disease_query: "prostate cancer"
    tissue_context: prostate
  
  - id: 3
    name: "Prostate Cancer Markers"
    cancer_type: "prostate cancer"
    tissue_context: prostate
  
  # Key Target Analysis
  - id: 2
