# OmniTarget Comprehensive Scenario YAML
#
# This configuration enables the testing of advanced pathway comparison and drug repurposing
# for breast cancer, using MCP server integrations.

hypothesis: "Cross-pathway validation and rational drug repurposing in breast cancer"
description: |
  Test advanced computational workflows for validating biological pathway coherence
  and discovering repurposing candidates using network propagation and mechanistic simulation.
  
  This analysis focuses on:
  - Pathway comparison between KEGG and Reactome databases
  - Drug repurposing for breast cancer pathways
  - Network-based validation and simulation
  - Cross-database concordance analysis
