# Target-Centric Analysis
#
# Comprehensive characterization of TP53 tumor suppressor gene
# including pathways, interactions, expression, and druggability.

hypothesis: "TP53 as a therapeutic target in cancer"

description: |
  Comprehensive analysis of TP53 including:
  - Multi-database target resolution (STRING, HPA, KEGG)
  - Pathway membership analysis (Reactome primary)
  - Interaction network (STRING + Reactome mechanistic)
  - Expression profiling (HPA tissue-specific)
  - Druggability assessment (KEGG drugs + localization)
