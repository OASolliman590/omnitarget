# AXL Inhibition in Breast Cancer - Complete Hypothesis Testing Workflow
#
# This configuration tests the hypothesis that AXL receptor tyrosine kinase
# inhibition disrupts oncogenic signaling pathways in breast cancer.
#
# Reference: Based on published studies showing AXL promotes invasion,
# metastasis, and therapy resistance in breast cancer.

hypothesis: "AXL inhibition disrupts oncogenic signaling in breast cancer"

description: |
  Testing the effects of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition on
  downstream pathways including:
  - p65 NF-κB signaling
  - VEGF angiogenesis
  - MMP9 invasion/metastasis
  - pAKT survival signaling
  - STAT3 signaling
  - Cyclin D1 proliferation
  - p38 MAPK signaling
  - MAPK/ERK pathway
  - Caspase-3 apoptosis
