# AXL Inhibition in Breast Cancer - Production-Ready Configuration
# Fully compliant with OmniTarget pipeline architecture (P0-6)
#
# Hypothesis: AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition disrupts oncogenic
# signaling pathways in breast cancer.
#
# Based on published studies showing AXL promotes invasion, metastasis,
# and therapy resistance in breast cancer.

hypothesis: "AXL inhibition disrupts oncogenic signaling in breast cancer"

description: |
  Testing the effects of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition on
  downstream pathways including:
  - p65 NF-κB signaling
  - VEGF angiogenesis
  - MMP9 invasion/metastasis
  - pAKT survival signaling
  - STAT3 signaling
  - Cyclin D1 proliferation
  - p38 MAPK signaling
  - MAPK/ERK pathway
  - Caspase-3 apoptosis
