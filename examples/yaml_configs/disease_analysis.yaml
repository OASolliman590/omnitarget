# Basic configuration for analyzing a single disease and constructing
# its associated pathway network with expression data.

hypothesis: "Comprehensive breast cancer network analysis"

description: |
  Build a comprehensive disease network for breast cancer including:
  - Disease-associated pathways from KEGG and Reactome
  - Protein-protein interaction network from STRING
  - Tissue-specific expression data from HPA
  - Cancer marker identification
  - Functional enrichment analysis
