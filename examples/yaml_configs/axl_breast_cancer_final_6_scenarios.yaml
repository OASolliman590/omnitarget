# AXL Inhibition in Breast Cancer - Complete Hypothesis Testing Workflow
# FULLY COMPLIANT - All 6 scenarios with reduced verbosity fixes
#
# This configuration tests the hypothesis that AXL receptor tyrosine kinase
# inhibition disrupts oncogenic signaling pathways in breast cancer.
#
# Scientific basis: AXL promotes invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance
# Testing effects on: p65 NF-κB, VEGF, MMP9, pAKT, STAT3, Cyclin D1, p38 MAPK,
#                    MAPK/ERK, Caspase-3
#
# COMPLIANT WITH PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE
# - All 6 scenarios included
# - 11 targets in MRA simulation (based on successful Oct 30 run)
# - simulation_mode: simple (stable mode)
# - No explicit output.path (auto-generated timestamped filename)
